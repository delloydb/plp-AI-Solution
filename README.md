## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 1. Code Completion with GitHub Copilot  
- Created a Python function to sort a list of dictionaries by key  
- Compared manual and AI-suggested solutions  
- Reflected on efficiency and code quality

### 2. Automated Testing using Testim.io  
- Designed a test suite for login functionality  
- Covered both valid and invalid credential scenarios  
- Captured test results and summarized outcomes

### 3. Predictive Analytics with Scikit-learn  
- Simulated issue prioritization using the Breast Cancer Dataset  
- Trained a Random Forest model to classify issue severity  
- Evaluated with accuracy and F1-score  
- Visualized feature importance

## 🧠 Ethical Reflection

Discussed potential biases in training datasets, particularly in issue prioritization systems. Proposed use of fairness assessment tools like IBM AI Fairness 360 to promote equitable model outcomes.
